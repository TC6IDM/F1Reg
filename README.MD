## About The Project - F1REG

This is a F1 Predictive Model that will attempt to predict theoretical fastest lap times for each driver on the grid. The model will be trained on historical data from previous seasons and will be tested on the 2025 season. The model will be trained on a variety of features such as track length, track type, weather, and driver performance. The model will be trained using a variety of machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, ... etc
